  "description": "ASCII Smuggling is a technique that embeds hidden instructions or data within seemingly benign text by leveraging invisible or non-rendering Unicode characters. These instructions are not visible to humans but are processed and interpreted by large language models (LLMs), enabling stealthy prompt injection or data encoding.\n\nSpecific methods include:\n\nUnicode Tags: Replaces regular letters and symbols with special tag versions from the Unicode Tags block. The content looks empty or harmless but can be decoded back into readable text.\n\nVariation Selectors: Converts data into a sequence of variation selectors \u2014 characters usually used to change how other symbols look. These selectors can be used to encode hidden bytes.\n\nSneaky Bits: Encodes binary data using pairs of special Unicode characters that represent 0s and 1s. This creates a hidden binary message that can be decoded without affecting the visible text.",
