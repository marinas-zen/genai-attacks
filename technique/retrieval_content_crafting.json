  "description": "The adversary writes content designed to be retrieved by user queries and influence a user of the system in some way. This abuses the trust the user has in the system.\nThe crafted content can be combined with a prompt injection. It can also stand alone in a separate document or email. The adversary must get the crafted content into a database (such as a vector database used in RAG) in the victim system. This may be accomplished via cyber access, or by abusing the ingestion mechanisms common in retrieval augmented generation systems (see RAG Poisoning).\nLarge language models may be used as an assistant to aid an adversary in crafting content.",
