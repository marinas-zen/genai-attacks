This may be accomplished by placing manipulated documents in a location the RAG indexes (see Gather RAG-Indexed Targets).\nThe content may be targeted such that it would always surface as a search result for a specific user query. The adversary\u2019s content may include false or misleading information. It may also include prompt injections with malicious instructions, or false RAG entries.",
