  "description": "The adversary is leveraging their knowledge of and access to the target system to tailor the attack.\n\nAI Attack Staging consists of techniques adversaries use to prepare their attack on the target AI model. Techniques can include training proxy models, poisoning the target model, and crafting adversarial data to feed the target model. Some of these techniques can be performed in an offline manner and are thus difficult to mitigate. These techniques are often used to achieve the adversary's end goal.",
